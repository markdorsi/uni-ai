## Code Snippets for Quick Copy-Paste

### Setting up Vitest

```bash
cd packages/core
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui @vitest/coverage-v8
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage"
  }
}
```

### Basic Test Example

```typescript
// packages/core/src/ai.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest'
import { ai } from './ai'

describe('ai()', () => {
  it('should generate text', async () => {
    // Mock the OpenAI provider
    // ... test code
  })
})
```

### React Package Structure

```
packages/react/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useChat.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useCompletion.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useStream.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Chat.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

## Time Budget

| Task | Estimated | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Testing setup | 8h | P0 |
| TypeScript fix | 4h | P0 |
| More tests | 8h | P0 |
| Anthropic provider | 8h | P0 |
| React package | 16h | P0 |
| Documentation | 4h | P1 |
| CI/CD setup | 4h | P1 |
| **Total** | **52h** | ~40h work week |

## Blockers & Risks

### Potential Blockers
1. **Anthropic API access** - Need API key for testing
   - Mitigation: Use mocks if no key available

2. **React testing complexity** - Hooks are tricky to test
   - Mitigation: Use React Testing Library patterns

3. **Time constraints** - Ambitious for 1 week
   - Mitigation: Focus on P0 items, defer P1

### Risk Management
- **Daily check-ins** - Review progress each evening
- **Scope flexibility** - Can push React to Week 3 if needed
- **Quality over speed** - Don't rush tests

---

## Notes & Tips

### Testing Best Practices
- Mock external APIs (don't hit real OpenAI in tests)
- Test error cases, not just happy path
- Use fixtures for test data
- Keep tests fast (<100ms each)

### React Hook Tips
- Use `useReducer` for complex state
- Memoize callbacks with `useCallback`
- Handle cleanup (abort streams on unmount)
- Make SSR-compatible (check for `window`)

### CI/CD Tips
- Cache node_modules for speed
- Run tests in parallel
- Fail fast on type errors
- Report bundle size changes

---

## End of Week Review Questions

1. Can someone install and use the SDK easily?
2. Are all core features tested?
3. Does it work with both OpenAI and Anthropic?
4. Can React developers use it with a simple hook?
5. Is the code quality high enough for public release?

If you can answer "yes" to all 5, you're ready for Week 3!
